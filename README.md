All questions of Codeforces EDU

I've decided to dedicate a significant part of my life to studying and delving into programming-related topics, with a particular focus on competitive programming.

I hope that my codes and texts can help other people to see various issues from new perspectives and to fall in love with this world, just as I have. 

I also want this work to bear fruit in the near future. 

That's all for now.
